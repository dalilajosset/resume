                I was a Commercial Lines Associate. My role in this company was to
                speak primarily with insurance agents inquiring about quotes for
                customers who had a commercial business, and work together to create
                personalized insurance quotes.

                department of AT&T. I would receive inbound calls from customers that
                wanted to possibly terminate any services with AT&T. My job was to
                resell the value of our products to ensure that the customer remained

                clerical work, such as answering phone calls for the manager, ordering
                parts for the equipment and machinery, filing of expenses and
                receipts, actively communicating with the ranch manager about any
